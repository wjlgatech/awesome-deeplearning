# awesome-deeplearning

## Objectives
I aim to make everythings here TRUE:
- Executable with code
- Understandable with *just enough* context and examples
- Reusable with simple & clear API (e.g. function, class, package)
- Transferable to another field, using best practices in graph ML and  ADEPT thinking= Analogy+Diagram+Example+PlainStorytelling+TechnicalAbstraction
