## Objectives
I aim to make everything here **TRUE**:
- **E**xecutable with code, **E**xpandable within a graph
- **U**nderstandable with *just enough* context and examples
- **R**eusable and **R**eproducible with simple & clear API (e.g. in the form of Python function, class, package)
- **T**ransferable and **T**ransformable to another domain and dimension, using best practices in graph ML and  ADEPT thinking= Analogy+Diagram+Example+PlainStorytelling+TechnicalAbstraction
